complete the implementation in sources/max_qos.sv.

This module calculates the max qos amongst the packets that are pending.
Design can take maximum 16 packets. There will be no case where more than 16 packets come.
QOS ranges from the value of 0-7 (3 bit signal)

The interface of this module consists of below inputs:
1. clk : 1 bit - clock used for synchronizing the data. Logic works on positive edge of clk
2. rst : 1 bit - positive edge syncronous reset. 

3. wr_vld : 1 bit - 1 value indicates the input traffic is valid. 0 indicate traffic is not valid
4. wr_id  : 4 bit - value contains the id of the packet. ID will not be repeated until that has been read out
5. wr_qos : 3 bit - value indicating the QOS of the packet. legal value 0-7 (unsigned)

6. rd_vld : 1 bit - 1 values that the packet is being read. Once the packet is read, QOS value for that is no longer valid for max_qos computation
7. rd_id  : 4 bit - value contains the id of the packet. ID can come only for the packets which are written in previous cycles and have not been read yet.


The interface of this module consists of below outputs:
1. rd_qos : 3 bit - stored value of the QOS for that packet. This is the value that came when wr_id came for that packet.
2. o_max_qos : 3 bit - maximum value of the QOS of the packets that are still in queue(written, but have not been read out).

Valid-Ready flow control is not present , so please keep storage for the maximum packets that can come.

Implementation guide:

Finding the max is compute intensive in hardware, please use the bargraph method of finding maximum.
Listing the steps below:

1. store the QOS in binary format.
2. Compute the bar graph version of QOS using tree structure to achieve minimum levels of combo logic. Showing below how it would look like:
	0 - 0000_0000
	1 - 0000_0001
	.
	.
	7 - 1111_1111
3. Find the maximum of the QOS in bar graph fashion by doing OR of all the valid values.
4. Convert the value to binary when sending on output.

Use optimized coding for 3 bit QOS to achieve maximum PPA.
